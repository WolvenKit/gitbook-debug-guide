    If the mod stopped working after you updated your game, it's possible that it is simply not up-to-date yet. Here are your options:
    - Play without it
    - Wait for the mod author to update it (if you ask, please ask **politely**)
    - Try and fix the mod yourself (this can be hard, but you are welcome on our [discord](http://discord.gg/redmodding) in `#mod-dev-chat`)!

    Open the mod's Nexus page. Do the following things:
    - **Read the mod description**. We get it, reading is hard, but somebody wrote all that text just for you!    
    - Open the comments tab. Is there a sticky comment? Read it.
    - Check the first two comment pages. Are a lot of people reporting the same bug? Is there a solution that you can try?
    - Is there a bug section? Check it out. If there are no bugs, you could file one.
